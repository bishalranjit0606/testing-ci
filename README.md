# About This Project

This is a class project where I explored and tested Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.  
I deployed a static website using **AWS S3** and wrote a YAML workflow file in GitHub Actions to automate CI testing whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

The workflow runs tests automatically, helping ensure code quality and faster feedback during development.
